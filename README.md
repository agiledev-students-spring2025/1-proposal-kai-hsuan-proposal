# BorrowTrack: A Mobile Web App for Tracking Borrowed Money

## What and Why?
BorrowTrack is a mobile web application designed to help individuals track money borrowed between friends, family, or colleagues. Many people struggle to keep track of informal loans, leading to forgotten debts, misunderstandings, and potential strain on relationships. This app solves this problem by providing a simple and intuitive platform where users can record, track, and manage loans efficiently.

With BorrowTrack, users can:
- Record borrowed and lent amounts.
- Set due dates and reminders.
- View transaction history and outstanding balances.
- Easily send notifications or reminders to borrowers.
- Categorize loans based on personal, business, or other types of transactions.

By offering a digital record of loans, BorrowTrack eliminates the guesswork and ensures transparency, making financial interactions smoother and more accountable.

## For Whom?
BorrowTrack is designed for individuals who frequently lend or borrow money in informal settings. This includes:
- Friends splitting bills or covering expenses for one another.
- Family members managing shared expenses or personal loans.
- Colleagues who engage in small-scale borrowing within teams.
- Freelancers and small business owners keeping track of payments.

The app will cater to people who need a reliable way to manage money between peers without resorting to spreadsheets or notes.

## How?
From the end-user's perspective, BorrowTrack will function as follows:
- Users create an account and add contacts.
- They can log a transaction by entering the amount, borrower/lender details, and an optional note.
- Transactions can be categorized and tagged for better organization.
- Users receive notifications when due dates approach.
- A dashboard displays outstanding balances and transaction summaries.
- The app will provide an option to send reminders via email or messaging apps.

## Scope
This project is well-suited for a group of 4-6 programmers within a semester. The key functionalities, such as user authentication, transaction logging, and notifications, are achievable within this timeframe. While additional features like automated repayment tracking or integrations with payment services could be considered for future iterations, the core system will focus on efficient money tracking and user-friendly interactions. 

By focusing on a clear and manageable feature set, BorrowTrack will deliver a valuable and practical tool without overextending the projectâ€™s scope.
